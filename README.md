## Project Background

Cedu was developed to address the knowledge gap among young cryptocurrency investors. With over 45% of young crypto investors reporting losses and 70% admitting to investing without fully understanding the risks, this platform aims to provide accessible, engaging, and trustworthy cryptocurrency education.

The application offers a dual approach: theoretical learning through structured courses, and experimental learning through a real-time paper trading simulator. This combination equips users with both the knowledge and practice needed to build confidence and competence in crypto trading - all without the financial risk.
